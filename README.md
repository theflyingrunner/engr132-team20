# engr132-team20
# How to use GitHub:
# Step 1:
   Check where the engr132-team20 repo is on your computer. For example, let's say my directory is: C:\project\engr132-team20. Open git bash and type in: 
   `cd "C:\project\engr132-team20"`
   It's just to highlight code. Now, you will be located within your local repository.
# Step 2:
   Before you begin working, you want to make sure you have all the updated files. In git bash, type in:
   `pull origin main`
   You will now have all the updated files.
# Step 3: 
   Now, you will want to create a new branch for you to work on the project so you don't change someone else's file. To do this, you'll need to think of a name for     
   your branch.  I'll type in: 
   `git branch name-of-your-branch`
   Now, you can begin working on your code.
# Step 4:
   When you're ready to upload your code, type in:
   `git add -A`
   Now, you have added all files to the staging area. You can now commit changes. Be sure to write a descriptive commit message or it won't work. Let's say I want 
   to say "fixed xlabel message for figure 1". We'll type in:
   `git commit -m "fixed xlabel message for figure 1"`
# Step 5:
   Almost there. Now, that you've commited changes, you are ready to upload to changes to the cloud. Type in:
   `git push origin name-of-your-branch`
# Step 6:
   Nice, your files are now in the cloud. Now open github.com and make sure your branch is up-to-date. When ready, notify the team and create a pull request. 
   You're done!
